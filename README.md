**Impacts of Climate change on the Marine  Phosphorus Cycle**  
 
**Goal:**   
Nowadays, the main trend of climate change is the increase of global temperature due to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activities, and the main manifestation in the oceans is the increase of seawater temperature and the acidification of the oceans, and therefore, our goal is mainly:  
Explore the effects of changes in seawater temperature rise on phosphorus cycling in the ocean;  
Explore the effects that changing acidic conditions will have on phosphorus cycling in the oceans.  

**Data used:**  
For this project, we use: 
1. ereefs https://portal.ereefs.info/  
2. Ocean Data View https://odv.awi.de/


**The planned analysis:**   
1、Generation of line graphs of precipitation changes in the Great Barrier Reef marine area (2012-2022)  
2、Generation of line graphs of temperature change in the Great Barrier Reef sea area (2012-2022)  
3、Generate a graph of the distribution of phosphorus concentrations in Great Barrier Reef water  
4、Changes in other essential elements of the Great Barrier Reef (comparison with data related to phosphorus)
