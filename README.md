Impacts of Climate change on the Marine  Phosphorus Cycle  
Goal:   
Nowadays, the main trend of climate change is the increase of global temperature due to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activities, and the main manifestation in the oceans is the increase of seawater temperature and the acidification of the oceans, and therefore, our goal is mainly:
Explore the effects of rising seawater temperatures on phosphorus cycling in the oceans;  
Explore the effects that acidic conditions will have on phosphorus cycling in the oceans.  
Data used:   
The planned analysis:
